This repository contains different utilities that can be used for Bazel,
specifically to be used with the C++ rules. These utilities are not critical for
using the rules and are not maintained by the Bazel team.  Feel free to fork. If 
you think you want to commit to maintaining them, you can try asking the owners of
https://github.com/bazel-contrib to add it there for more visibility.
